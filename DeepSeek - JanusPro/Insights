🌟 Features of JanusPro:
Image Detection:
- Upload an image and ask JanusPro questions about it! The model processes the image and generates responses based on your query.

⚠️ Disadvantages:
No Continuous Chat Functionality:
- Currently, users need to re-enter a prompt for each session (image detection or generation), as continuous conversation is not yet supported.

Limited in Complex Problem-Solving:
- JanusPro may struggle with more advanced tasks, such as solving complex math problems or linear equations.
